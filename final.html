	<h3>Project Description</h3>
	<p>We recreated the classic and simple game of TicTacToe using our knowledge in programming and Pygames.</p>	
      </li>
      <li>
	<h3>Instructions</h3>
	<p>Instruction: In the webpage attached, in the guideline and download tabs, there will be a download link where you can 
                                download our file of the recreation. (add) </p>	
      </li>
      <li>
	<h3>How it Works</h3>
	<p> The player would be able to click anywhere in a 3x3 table we created in the program and it should be able to place an O or X, depending on
		the sprite they are assigned to. When one of the players get three in a row, they would win and the game will end and if there is a tie, the game should reset.</p>
